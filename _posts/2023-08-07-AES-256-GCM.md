# AES 256 GCM

**Symmetric-key algorithm**: same / transformable keys are used to both encrypt and decrypt by the sender and the receiver

**Block Cipher**: a deterministic algorithm that operates on a fixed-length of bits called **blocks**

**Counter Mode**: 
* The key and the IV (nonce) appended with a counter increasing from 0 to N to form a key stream of blocks
    $$E_K(Nonce + counter_0),...,E_K(Nonce + counter_N)$$
* The output of the encrypted ith nonce + counter will be xored with the plain text block $$i$$ to create cipher block $$i$$
* IV is used to make sure the attacker will not be able to guess the counters
* Does not require padding as the last partial block will be XORed with the last partial plaintext
* Any partial block from the previous TCP segment will be used
    * Streams of keystream blocks and plaintext (TCP byte stream)

**GCM**:
* Similar to counter mode but the cipher text (XOR of encrypted counted with plain text) will be used as coefficients of polynomial for auth tag (ie $$AD * H^N + C_1 * H^{N-1} + C_2 * H^{N-2}...$$)

**AES**: 
* 256 bit blocks
* Steps:
    1. Key Expansion: AES key schedule:
        * AES 256 requires 30 round of expansions from the cipher key
    2. Initial round key addition: each byte of the state (plain text) is XORed with the round key
    3. 13 Rounds of:
        1. SubBytes: each byte is replaced with another from a static lookup table
        2. Shift row steps:bytes are cyclically shifted
        3. MixColumns:
        4. AddRoundKey
    4. Final Round:
        1. SubBytes
        2. ShiftRows
        3. AddRoundKey
