# MD5 (RFC 1321)

**Terminology**:
* `word`: 32 bit quantity
* `byte`: 8 bit quantity
* $$X <<< 3$$: circularly rotating $$X$$ by 3 times

## MD5 Algorithm

To find the md5 for a message $$m$$ of $$b$$-bits, where $$m$$ can be visualized as

$$m_0 \, m_1 \,  \cdots \, m_{b-1} $$ 

### Step 1: Appending Padding Bits

The mesage is padded so that its length is congruent to $$448$$, modulo $$512$$. This means after padding the message length is 64 bits shy of being a multiple of 512. Formally:

$$ m\_size \cong 448 \, (modulo \, 512)$$

Padding: to pad the message to the desired length, a single `1` bit is appended followed by `0` bits. At lease 1 bit (length $$447 \% %512$$) or  at most 512 bit (already $$448$$).

### Step 2: Append length

A 64-bit representation of $$b$$ (length of the message before padding) is appeneded to the result of step 2. If $$b > 2^64$$, only the lower 64 bits of b are used.

At this point the message is a multiple of $$512$$ and multple of $$16$$ (32 bit) words.

Now let the following denote the words of the resulting message where $$N$$ is a multiple of 16

$$M[0,\, \cdots \,,N-1]$$

### Step 3: Initialize MD Buffer

A buffer of four word (4 x 32 bit) $$(A, B, C, D)$$ is used to compute the MD5

$$word\, A:\, 01\, 23\, 45\, 67$$

$$word\, B:\, 89\, ab\, cd\, ef$$

$$word\, C:\, fe\, dc\, ba\, 98$$

$$word\, D:\, 76\, 54\, 32\, 10$$

### Step 4: Process Message in 16-Word Blocks (512 bits)

For every 512 bits, peform a set of complex operations on the buffer. These complex operations are bit wise parallel (see [Step 4. Processing in 16-Word Blocks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1321#section-3.4)) for more information.

### Step 5: Output

The final MD5 is just the concat the buffer `DCBA`
